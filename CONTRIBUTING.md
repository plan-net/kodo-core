# Contributing to kodosumi

Thank you for considering contributing to kodosumi! This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for contributing to this project.

## General Guidelines

- Follow, amend, and extend the [Glossary](https://serviceplangroup.atlassian.net/l/cp/9j3a0r3w) as needed.
- Ensure your contributions are clear and concise.

## Coding Style Guide

We follow PEP8 guidelines for Python code, but we are not overly strict about it. The main guidelines each contributor should follow are summarized below:

### Indentation and Line Length

- Use 4 whitespaces for indentation, no tabulators.
- Aim for a maximum line length of around 80 characters. We do not mind if it is slightly above or below (e.g., 79ish or 80ish).

### Spacing

- Separate classes by two blank lines.
- Separate functions and methods by one blank line.
- Put one space around variable assignments (e.g., `x = 1`).
- Do not put spaces around list indexes, function calls, or keyword assignments (e.g., `func(a=1, b=2)`).

### Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with underscores to separate terms for functions, variables, and attributes (e.g., `my_function`, `my_variable`).
- Precede protected attributes with a leading underscore (e.g., `_protected_attribute`).
- Precede private attributes with double leading underscores (e.g., `__private_attribute`).
- Use _CamelCase_ for classes and exceptions (e.g., `MyClass`, `MyException`).
- Write constants in uppercase (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).
- Use `self` for instance methods and `cls` for class methods.

### Imports

- Always place import statements at the top of the file.

### Documentation

- Write documentation if something is not obvious.
